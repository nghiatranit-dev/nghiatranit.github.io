**Research:** My focus is on software engineering and information systems, with particular interest in applying modern architectural patterns such as Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design, and microservices. I enjoy working with C#, ASP.NET Core, and relational databases, aiming to design scalable and maintainable systems. My background includes strong foundations in Algorithms, Data Structures, and Object-Oriented Programming (with Design Patterns), which I apply to both academic projects and practical web development.

**Previously:** I received my Master’s degree in Information Technology, specializing in Information Systems, from the University of Science. During my studies, I completed several academic projects, including distributed database management for Big Data, Internet Banking applications with RSA & PGP integration, and POS systems. My Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology also provided extensive exposure to software development, database systems, and applied programming.
